1. I am a very terrible engineer in many ways but I am also not trying to be the best.  My code isn't good but its designed to get me going fast.
2. I'm faced with many challenges - coding in web3 land is vastly complex arena.  The code presented contains hacks / is likely highly inefficient / needs help!
3. I decided to get into scraping after trying to code with GPT and also code myself using well-known libraries like web3 (which cGPT only has knowledge of old versions)

Imagine you're trying to build an MVP quickly and use the tools available and when you run commands, it fails after you use cGPT but when you install those tools because of cGPT, cGPT knows old versions but you've installed the latest version.  For example, cGPT only knows Node JS web3@1.3.4 (although it did say earlier it knew some 1.5.X version!?!?!?!) and when you run npm install web3 it installs 4.1.2 - now ideally if you're a great dev, you should be able to diagnose this shit and also read the docs and fix it, but you want cGPT to follow along so you can get moving fast.  You either install the old version (which likely has vulnerabilities) or you install the new version and modify your code - which is a problem because all the code that cGPT gives you will be for the old version.

Long story short - this a hacky project.  Help me.  Give me advice / guidance.  I am ready for it.
