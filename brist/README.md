an experiment. an idea i've had for a while.  let's see where this gooooooooes....

# tldr goal

money in an ethereum wallet generates interest.  the interest forever gets given away forever in perpetuty as long as ethereum works or as long at the internet is working.  people apply.  people vote.  some will game it.  we will optimize.  it will be a fun experiment but at least its a try at an idea ive had for a while.

the wallet starts with my own cash and isn't disclosed.  eventually if this thing takes off, anyone can put money in and contribute and it will increase the interest balance because anyone can put money in the pot.

let's see wtf happens.

# goal

to build a non-profit funding platform that allows users to register and automatically submit their projects / proposals and allow people to vote on them.  users must connect their social media accounts for validation of their honesty.  non-profits / grantees can submit their projects / proposals, can withdraw their funds if they are not on the platform and they have been submited by users (maybe up to a limit so i don't have to escrow funding?), can are encouraged to upload what they are doing with the funding after they accept it.  connects users and non-profits together.  users can generate a pdf of their donation for tax purposes.  after a certain amount the ethereum wallet will be revealed but to test i will deposit a balance and test with a small group of users to see if it works.
